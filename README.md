EventPro - Event Ticket Management System

A simple, yet effective web application for managing events and booking tickets, built with Python and Streamlit.
üìã Description

EventPro provides a straightforward interface for both administrators and users. Admins can create, manage, and delete events, as well as view all the bookings for each event. Users can browse the list of upcoming events and book their tickets with ease.

The application uses a local SQLite database to persist all data, making it a self-contained and easy-to-run project.
